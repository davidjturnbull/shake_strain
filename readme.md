Shake Strain
---
Shake Strain is a simple mobile focused AngularJS app I built to try working with the framework. I’ve tried to follow standard dev patterns for AngularJS although for simplicity I’ve hardcoded the JSON  to simulate an API without actually needing to run a Node server. 


The app itself is aimed at professional bartenders and designed to display drinks simply and quickly. The recipes are presented in a 'recipe spec' format - it is assumed that the person looking for the recipe already knows how to make drinks so there is very little 'hand-holding' - just the essential info needed to make a drink.
